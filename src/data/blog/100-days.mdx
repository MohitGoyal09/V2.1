#### Introduction 👋

Hello! I’m Mohit Goyal, a sophomore, pursuing a Computer Science degree. I aim to gain knowledge of MERN stack and Machine Learning and land at least one internship before my pre-final year. This post chronicles my 100 Days of Code journey, where I committed to coding every day for 100 days straight. Whether you’re a fellow coder, a curious onlooker, or someone considering their coding challenge, I hope my experiences resonate with and inspire you.

#### The Beginning 🌱

Each project presented unique challenges and learning opportunities, contributing significantly to my growth as a developer.

### Biggest Challenges and Solutions 💪

1. **Challenge:** Grasping complex Data Structures and Algorithms concepts **Solution:** Created visual aids and implemented daily coding practice on platforms like LeetCode and GfG
2. **Challenge:** Staying consistent with coding daily, especially on busy or low-energy days. **Solution:** Created a minimal daily goal (e.g., 30 minutes of coding) and built a streak-tracking habit
3. **Challenge:** Managing the complexity of full-stack projects. **Solution:** Adopted Agile methodologies and broke projects into smaller, manageable tasks
4. **Challenge:** Balancing learning new concepts with building projects. **Solution:** I adopted a project-based learning approach, choosing projects that required me to learn and apply new skills.
5. **Challenge:** Understanding the math behind Machine Learning algorithms **Solution:** Revisited fundamental mathematics and statistics, utilizing online courses and visualizations.

### Key Learnings 🧠

1. **Consistency rules strength:** Small daily efforts add to big improvements over time.
2. **The power of community:** Connecting with fellow coders accelerates learning and provides essential support.
3. **Accept mistakes as learning opportunities:** Debugging isn’t just about fixing code; It is an opportunity to deepen understanding.
4. **How to study:** Finding effective study methods is as important as the content.
5. **Balancing breadth and depth of learning:** Knowing when to dive deep and when to explore is the key to successful growth.
6. **Don’t waste time planning:** Dive in and start coding. Over-planning can be a form of procrastination.
